## Monokai Vibrant
I like Monokai. I like Monokai with vibrant colors and minimal styling even more. Borders are only slightly visible. Kept a lot of things plain white to counteract the colorfulness.

## Theme
Monokai Vibrant Theme based on jonotansberg "tweaked Monokai Dark Soda" .tmTheme. https://github.com/jonatansberg/Monokai-Dark-Soda.tmTheme
